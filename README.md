## To play the game, please download the entire folder and use the Android Studio to run the it:
* Download the file and then unzip it somewhere locally on your computer
* In Android Studio, choose: File -> New -> Import Project..., then navigate to the

* You should see the little Android Studio icon next to the directory name; thatâ€™s

* Then click OK.
